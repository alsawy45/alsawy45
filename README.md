- I have over 18 years of diversified professional experience in different roles ranging from technical representative positions to customer service management roles in the telecommunication sector.

After 18 years of work, I realized the crucial role data science play in our lives in general and in businesses in particular, with plenty of untapped opportunities yet to be seized.

Following my passion for data analysis and business analysis, I have embarked on a new chapter of lifelong learning to benefit the world with my newly acquired skills in Python, R, and Tableau and relevant collaboration platforms knowledge.
